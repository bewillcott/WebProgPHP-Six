# Web Programming Portfolio Activity 5
This is a TAFE assignment for the Diploma in Software Development, at the South Metropolitan TAFE,
Rockingham, Western Australia.

The project task is to write a PHP program that generates 100 integer
numbers between 1 and 10, and represents the occurrence of each number
(e.g. five 1s, four 2s, six 3s, etc....) with a bar chart.

The relevant files are:

- `index.php`
- `GetBarChart.php`
- `BarChart.php`

These files are in the `www` directory.

### BarChart
The file `BarChart.php` contains the class **BarChart**.  This class is used to collect the
information and settings required to build a bar chart, and provides the means to do so.

### GetBarChart.php
This file contains an example use case of the **BarChart** class.

### General Note
You are welcome to use any part of the coding you find in this project, as it is Open Source.
However, be mindful of the License - GPL v3.

Some of the code, as noted in the class file, has been copied from another source.
The ideas are an accumulation of information from many sources, all from one internet
source or another.

Due to the challenge of getting it all together into a usable form, I am publishing it all here
for those of you in need of a starting point.

Have fun coding :)  
Brad.
