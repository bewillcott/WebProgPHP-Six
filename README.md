# Web Programming Portfolio Activity 6
This is a TAFE assignment for the Diploma in Software Development, at the South Metropolitan TAFE,
Rockingham, Western Australia.

The project task is to a simple PHP website for membership management.

I have included a Java Application project (`PrototypeSite`) which is there to facilitate the generation 
of the prototype site.
