# Web Programming Portfolio Activity 6
## Prototype Site
This project is here to make it easier to prototype the website.

The project uses my own maven plugins, which unfortunately have not yet been uploaded 
to Maven Central:

- `bewsoftware-mdj-plugin`
- `bewsoftware-version-plugin`

### bewsoftware-mdj-plugin
This plugin requires the following projects to be downloaded and built:

- `bewsoftware-libs` : https://github.com/bewillcott/bewsoftware-libs
- `bewsoftware-mdj` : https://github.com/bewillcott/bewsoftware-mdj
- `bewsoftware-mdj-cli`: https://github.com/bewillcott/bewsoftware-mdj-cli
- `bewsoftware-mdj-plugin` : https://github.com/bewillcott/bewsoftware-mdj-plugin

Each will need to be built in that order.  There may be some problems until the first 
successful build of each, sorry.

### bewsoftware-version-plugin
This plugin requires the following plugins/projects:

- `bewsoftware-libs` : https://github.com/bewillcott/bewsoftware-libs
- `bewsoftware-mdj-plugin`
- `bewsoftware-version-plugin`
